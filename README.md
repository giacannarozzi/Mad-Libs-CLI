# Mad Libs CLI Project
A fun, interactive Mad Libs–style command-line game written in Python!

Users fill in prompts like adjectives, nouns, and verbs — and the program creates a silly story based on their responses.

# Overview
This project recreates the classic Mad Libs word game right in your terminal.

You’ll be asked to enter different types of words (like adjectives, nouns, emotions, etc.), and the program will insert them into a pre-written story template.

Each run creates a new, funny, and random story!
